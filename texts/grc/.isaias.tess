<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.3>	3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his ’s crib: Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.4>	4 Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the LORD, they have scorned the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backward.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.5>	5 Why will ye be still stricken, (that) ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.6>	6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head (there is) no soundness in it; wound, and weal, and putrefying sore: they have not been pressed out, neither bound up, neither is it mollified with oil.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.7>	7 Your country is a desolation, your cities are burned with ﬁre; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is a desolation, like an overthrow of strangers.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.8>	8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a ’tent in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.12>	12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.13>	13 Bring no more vain (meal-) offerings; incense is an abomination unto me; new moons and sabbaths, callings of assemblies; I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meetings.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.14>	14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a cumbrance unto me: I am weary of bearing.

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.24>	24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.1.25>	25 And I will bring back mine hand upon thee, and purge away as (with) lye thy dross, and take away all thine alloy:

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.2.3>	3 And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up tothe mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.2.4>	4 And he shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.3.8>	8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to defy the eyes of his glory.

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.7.2>	2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Aram rested

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.8.5>	5 And the LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

<.isaias urn:cts:hebrewlit:heb0001.heb010.1st1K-eng1.28.16>	16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am he that hath founded in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-, stone of sure foundation; he that believeth shall not be in haste.
